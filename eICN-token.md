# What is eICN?
On Sep 27th 2018 it was announced that ICONOMI would be setting up a new company called "ICONOMI AG" based in Liechtenstein in order to bring legal clarity to ICONOMI shareholders. ICN token holders will be able to swap their ICN tokens for tokenised equity tokens called eICN starting November 1st 2018 or can exchange their ICN tokens for ETH at a fixed rate of .0019ETH. This page will attempt to document all official communication from ICONOMI with regards to eICN.

Main importance for ICN hodlers was buybacks... And the fees....
With this going away, how does a eICN holder benefit if ICONOMI does well and grows?
*Asked by @mennopp*

> If ICONOMI performs well and grows, this should be reflected in the rising value of eICN. Profit can also be paid out to shareholders if they decide this via the General Assembly (e.g. dividends or buybacks).
> *Answered 28th Sep 2018*

Please hold a dedicated AMA for the incorporation with 10+ questions answered (pretty please)
*Asked by @albertid*

> We will continue to release information and we will be collecting the most commonly asked questions, which will be answered in a comprehensive blog post.
> *Answered 28th Sep 2018*

Does today’s announcement mean that USA holders who are ineligible for tier 2 status on icn site will be forced to liquidate at .0019 eth?
*Asked by @stephen*

> US ICN holders and holders from other countries that are currently unable to verify for Tier 2 are able to hold their ICN indefinitely without liquidating. We are proactively looking for a solution that will enable these ICN holders to convert their ICN to eICN. We will be opening a communication channel where we will keep these holders informed about our progress.
> *Answered 28th Sep 2018*

If I own 1% of ICN and choose to convert to eICN, will I then own 1% of eICN? Or will additional shares be issued?
*Asked by @UncleJun*

> Yes, ownership of 1% of ICN will represent ownership of 1% of eICN.
> *Answered 28th Sep 2018*

What will happen with the ICN that will be swapped against ETH?
Will the eICN supposed to be equivalent to these ICN be burned, so less shares created?
*Asked by @zoulman*

> 1. ICN swapped for ETH will go into the treasury and will go through the eICN conversion process.
> 2. No, but there may be minor differences due to rounding.
> *Answered 28th Sep 2018*

Is it possible that new security tokenss could pay out dividends or will there still be a buyback burnout model?
*Asked by @investmox*

> Both of these models are possible. The final decision on how profits will be used will be up to the General Assembly.
> *Answered 28th Sep 2018*

Will there be an official document on the ownership of the company's shares?
*Asked by @bumerang007*

> Yes, there will.
> *Answered 28th Sep 2018*

The number of ICNs specified in CCP will be distributed among ICN owners?
*Asked by @bumerang007*

>  Pinta’s assets will be moved to the treasury and as such will still be under ICONOMI's ownership. We will be publishing more information next week.
> *Answered 28th Sep 2018*

Will there be a lock-up period for eICN? If so, how long?
*Asked by @UncleJun*

> The process of exchanging ICN tokens for shares in ICONOMI AG will start on November 1, 2018 and last until December 31, 2018. Until the allocation of shares is complete, ICN deposited on the platform, either for the purpose of exchanging for ETH or swapping for ICONOMI AG shares, will be locked. On January 10, 2019 the process will continue by paying out the ETH or by allocating shares to those who have opted for it. The eICN process, meaning tokenization of the shares of ICONOMI AG, is scheduled to begin in Q1 2019.
*Answered 19th October 2018*

will there be a fixed supply of eICN and a circulating supply replicating ICNs? (so eICN will also include 'burned' eICN?)
*Asked by @jesusthatsgreat*

> The supply of eICN will be determined based on the number of shares of ICONOMI AG that will be issued. However, as eICN is expected to be similar to regular shares in the company, based on corporate law, in some cases there could be a new emission of shares (or eICN tokens) or a reduction. Supply will therefore not be fixed.
*Answered 19th October 2018*

Will profits on the sale of assets now be 100% used to fund business expenses / expansion as opposed to being partially distributed to shareholders as was the case with Pinta?
*Asked by @jesusthatsgreat*

>  Any profits from the sale of assets will be put into the company balance sheet, which will increase the value of company holdings. Based on the corporate law that defines joint-stock companies, it is up to the general assembly to decide whether these profits are used for the development of the company or distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.

# FAQs Published by ICONOMI

Can I change my mind after submitting my non-binding interest/completing the exchange process?

> Yes. If an ICN token holder changes their preference, they can revisit www.iconomi.com at any time during the non-binding period, click the “Convert ICN” button, and cancel their previous choice. After cancellation, ICN token holders can repeat the process by choosing to convert a smaller amount of their ICN tokens into ICONOMI AG shares, choosing not to convert their ICN tokens at all, choosing to exchange their ICN tokens for ETH instead of converting them into ICONOMI AG shares. The only process that is final and unable to be changed is the exchange of ICN tokens for ETH (see below). The process can be repeated several times within the periods indicated in our latest announcement.

> Notwithstanding the above, please note that since the first exchange of ICN tokens into ETH will be done in December 2018, i.e., during the first round of submission of non-binding interest to convert ICN tokens into ICONOMI AG shares, once the process of exchange of ICN tokens for ETH is irreversible (please see the technical description below), ICN token holders can no longer change their mind about exchanging their ICN tokens for ETH.

What is the conversion rate between ICN tokens and ICONOMI AG shares?

> We currently predict that the conversion rate between ICN tokens and ICONOMI AG shares will be 10:1 (i.e., for every 10 ICN tokens, 1 ICONOMI AG share will be issued). This is merely a mathematical operation for determining the value of one ICONOMI AG share and still retains our obligation to treat each ICN token holder equally.

> If an ICN token holder has a number of ICN tokens not divisible by 10, they will be compensated in ETH for the balance of the ICN tokens they will not be able to convert into ICONOMI AG shares.

What is the technical process of exchanging ICN tokens for ETH?

> ICN token holders who transfer their ICN tokens to the ICONOMI platform for exchange for ETH from October 30, 2018 to approximately December 10, 2018 (so that the transfer of ICN tokens will be mined on the Ethereum blockchain up to and including block number 6867000) will be included in the first batch of the exchange. The block number is due to be reached on approximately December 10, 2018, but this cannot be precisely predicted (the current latest block can be seen at https://etherscan.io/blocks at the top the table). ETH will be sent to these ICN token holders’ wallets no later than December 31, 2018.

> ICN token holders who transfer their ICN tokens to the ICONOMI platform for exchange for ETH from approximately December 11, 2018 (see above) to December 31, 2018 (so that the transfer of ICN tokens will be mined on the Ethereum blockchain up to and including a predefined block number; the exact block number will be publicly announced after December 10, 2018 and no later than December 14, 2018) will be included in the second batch of the exchange. The block number is due to be reached on approximately December 31, 2018 but cannot be precisely predicted (the current latest block can be seen at https://etherscan.io/blocks at the top the table). ETH will be sent to these ICN token holders’ wallets no later than January 15, 2019.

Will the fee for later converting ICN to eICN be a nominal fee to cover costs, or is it intended to go up over time, even if the holders of those ICN tokens still aren’t able to convert to eICN?

> Most likely a nominal fee to cover costs, but this will be finalized in the future.

Could you set a contract to temporarily freeze ICN given from those who would like to lock in at a fair price, even possibly based on ICO contribution, without the need to be disqualified from conversion to eICN as of next month?

> Thank you for your suggestion and perspective, but the process has been finalized and the user interface released.

Will 1:ICN/x:eICN always be honored?

> The ICN to ICONOMI AG share ratio will not change, though there may be additional fees. It will no longer be possible to convert ICN to eICN after December 31, 2019.

What is the reason for waiting for 2019 if you want to swap your ICN for ETH?

> The timeline is in place for operational reasons. We needed to ensure we would have enough time to carry out the exchange process without any issues for those who choose to convert their ICN to ETH.

Does ICONOMI intend to obtain a MIFID II license in accordance with the Liechtenstein Banking Act so it can offer investments in security tokens through the ICONOMI platform?

> We are investigating this option. We believe there will be many security tokens in the future, and being competitive in this field may require licenses of this kind, depending on the jurisdiction.

When will the first general assembly take place?

> The date of the first general assembly has not been set. We will publicly announce the date once it has been defined.

Since ICONOMI has officially stated ICN will always be able to be exchanged for eICN past the December 31 deadline with an additional fee, does that also mean the ratio of 1% ICN will equate to 1% eICN if exchanged after the Dec 31st deadline?

> Yes, this ratio will not change after December 31, 2018. However, as stated previously, there may be additional fees.

If eICN will not be tradeable, will you purchase/sell eICN over the counter on the platform?

> This is a possibility for the future. Our current focus is on executing the conversion process smoothly. We believe security token exchanges will be a major trend in 2019, and we look forward to being part of it.

Since you will be buying ICN significantly below book value at .0019 ETH, are you concerned that large shareholders will just convert to eICN so they can vote to liquidate eICN at book value at the first vote?

> This is not something we are concerned about.

Is eICN covered under the Malta VFA act?

> Because ICONOMI AG shares will be securities, they are not covered under the Malta VFA Act.

Will you buy ICN at .0019 even if exchanges don’t delist ICN? Which exchanges would have to delist ICN for you to buy at that floor?

> Yes, the option to sell your ICN to ICONOMI at the rate of .0019 will be available even if exchanges don’t delist ICN. This option will not require verification on the ICONOMI platform.

Will ICN tokens have a comparable exchange rate for eICN indefinitely?

> Once established, the exchange rate between ICN and eICN will not change. However, there may be additional fees for conversion after December 31.

How long before the release of eICN?

> The release of eICN is targeted for Q1 2019.

On which exchanges will eICN be traded?

> We are researching different options, but it is too early to comment about exchanges at this time.

Can you develop further on how exchanges such as Kraken/Binance will process the ICN to eICN token transition? Are you working together with them? Is it possible that this will be done automatically?

> Conversion to eICN will take place on the ICONOMI platform. Full details of the process will be published by the end of the month. How exchanges handle ICN is up to their discretion.

Compared to the buyback and burn system, what will change with eICN?

> If ICONOMI performs well and grows, this should be reflected in the rising value of eICN. As we have mentioned before, profit can also be paid out to shareholders if they decide this via the General Assembly (e.g. dividends or buybacks).

Will we be able to vote on and propose a change of strategy (for example, more resources allocated to marketing, in search of large funds such as Grayscale or others)?

> Shareholders will have all the rights accorded by standard corporate governance.

Are DAAs able to hold eICN? After all, you choose a DAA manager to be in charge of your crypto related investments.

>For the time being, no.

Is it necessary to come personally to receive shares? What documents are needed apart from the Tier 2 documents?

> No, you will not be required to come personally to receive shares. More information about the documents required will be released in future. The types of documents required should not differ substantially from those required to open a bank account, for example. For those who are Tier 2 verified, we already have most of the required documents/information, which will not need to be resubmitted; only the missing documents/information will be required.

Will eICN be an ERC20 token?

> The final structure of the eICN token has not yet been finalized.

In the Medium posts on eICN, both the terms equity token and security token are used. Do you consider these terms interchangeable?

> eICN is an equity token. We use the terms interchangeably in the sense that an equity token is a particular type of security.

Will it be possible to convert part of my ICN position into eICN and convert part into ETH on the ICONOMI platform?

> Yes.

Will the people who convert their ICN to ETH with ICONOMI get their ETH immediately or after December 31?

> The exact timeline will be published together with the full details about the process.

Since ICONOMI said they are looking for a solution for US/Canada holders of ICN to convert to eICN, does that mean if they hold 1% of ICN that it would equate to 1% eICN for US/Canada holders as well?

> The ICN to eICN ownership ratio is the same for anyone who will be able to convert their ICN. We are actively seeking a solution for those holders who are currently not eligible. If you are an ICN holder who is unable to verify for Tier 2 on the ICONOMI platform, please contact us at eicn.support@iconomi.com

I have one question: will we get dividends if we convert ICN to eICN?

> As previously mentioned, profit can be paid out to shareholders if they decide this via the General Assembly (e.g. dividends or buybacks).
