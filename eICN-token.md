# What is eICN?
On Sep 27th 2018 it was announced that ICONOMI would be setting up a new company called "ICONOMI AG" based in Liechtenstein in order to bring legal clarity to ICONOMI shareholders. ICN token holders will be able to swap their ICN tokens for tokenised equity tokens called eICN starting November 1st 2018 or can exchange their ICN tokens for ETH at a fixed rate of .0019ETH. This page will attempt to document all official communication from ICONOMI with regards to eICN.

With this going away, how does a eICN holder benefit if ICONOMI does well and grows?
*Asked by @mennopp*

> If ICONOMI performs well and grows, this should be reflected in the rising value of eICN. Profit can also be paid out to shareholders if they decide this via the General Assembly (e.g. dividends or buybacks).

Does today’s announcement mean that USA holders who are ineligible for tier 2 status on icn site will be forced to liquidate at .0019 eth?
*Asked by @stephen*

> US ICN holders and holders from other countries that are currently unable to verify for Tier 2 are able to hold their ICN indefinitely without liquidating.

We will be opening a communication channel where we will keep these holders informed about our progress.

What will happen with the ICN that will be swapped against ETH?

Since ICONOMI said they are looking for a solution for US/Canada holders of ICN to convert to eICN, does that mean if they hold 1% of ICN that it would equate to 1% eICN for US/Canada holders as well?
