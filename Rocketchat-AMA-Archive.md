# Rocket.chat AMA Archive

Questions asked on the ICONOMI Rocket.chat on the #amaquestions channel are answered by the team. However these answers may over time become difficult to find due to the continuous scrolling nature of the Rocket.chat. As such, answered questions will be archived on this page for posterity and ease of reference. 
  
# Q1
When do you envision any user, big or small, being able to use the fiat gateway for deposits? 
*Asked by @ironjack*

> The first stage of the fiat ramp-up will be ready this month. We'll explain the process in more detail in a blog post, so stay tuned.
*Answered May 21st 2018*

# Q2
Has Rocket.Chat became what ICONOMI expected from it? 
*Asked by @southside*

> In short, the answer is "yes", especially from a security standpoint. Since the ICONOMI ICO, we've witnessed an evolution of our community and chat platforms, which is common for all companies, regardless of whether they are blockchain-based or not. We have to constantly adjust our communication streams and determine where our current and potential users are spending time. Rocket.Chat has allowed us to create a *safe, structured environment for our users*, which was our main reason for migrating, and we love to see your engagement in the conversation. We are also constantly considering your feedback about what improvements you would like to see, which is part of the reason we just created the #random channel for random and off-topic conversations (thanks @ironjack for the suggestion).
*Answered May 21st 2018*

# Q3
Will ICN tokens ever be purchasable on the platform?
*Asked by @ironjack*

> Once purchasing digital assets individually is available on the platform this will be a possibility, but no final decisions have been made.
*Answered May 22nd 2018*

# Q4
Recently one of our higher profile DAA managers William Mougayar announced he is starting his own blockchain investment firm. In any company attrition can be expected. Is iconomi working to figure out what the leading causes of attrition are on the platform and putting processes and features in place to prevent it (please give an example if one exists)?
*Asked by @stephen*

> DAA managers want more coins and more possibilities for active trading. As you probably noticed, we are currently in the process of adding ten new coins to the platform, many of which were heavily requested by DAA managers. We are also upgrading our management interface to provide the features managers want. In short, we are consistently moving toward being able to satisfy all of our managers desires for the platform, but we can't do so all at once. As platform functionality and coin selection grows, the attrition rate will decrease accordingly.
*Answered May 23rd 2018*

# Q5
What ratio of future marketing will there be towards large investors vs. average users? For example, 50/50, 80/20, etc? 
*Asked by @ironjack*

> As time goes on, we will continue leaning further in the direction of targeting average users, though we will also continue to appeal to larger investors and institutions. Our landing page redesign was one example of this move toward targeting the average user. Additionally, DAA managers are already starting to launch their own marketing campaigns, which will be conducted according to their own standards and may have different segments in mind.
*Answered May 23rd 2018*

# Q6
Why isn't there any mention of the ICN Token on Iconomi's Homepage? Not even on the About Us page. I believe that you owe it to your Supporters/Investors who bought the ICO that there is a clear explanation on how Iconomi was funded in the first place and the value the ICN Token represents. 
*Asked by @mons*

> We're planning a separate page on our website where we will include more information on our company history as well as topics like the ICN token. We don't have a timeframe for this yet, but it's a higher-priority item for the comms department.
*Answered May 24th 2018*

# Q7
Did people already apply to use the fiat gateway OTC deal? 
*Asked by @martijn*

> Yes! Since the announcement, we are already in discussions with several users who have expressed interest in making OTC deals.
*Answered June 5th 2018*

# Q8
Iconomi team is it possible to make a new Marketing channel in Rocket Chat to communicate marketing actions and propose new ideas, even marketing actions of other cryptocurrencies that we see interesting for Iconomi? Thanks.
*Asked by @duquedelmonte*

> This is something we'll consider for the future, but for now we don't want to have too many channels and dilute the content.
*Answered June 5th 2018*

# Q9
With the TrueUSD token added to the platform, we may see Managers more frequently rebalance more than 10% of their portfolio per month. This triggers a fee payable in ICN tokens. How does this fee work. Is it a flat fee, or based on the percentage over 10% of the portfolio, or related to the value of the portfolio rebalance, or on the fees incurred by Iconomi when rebalancing? 
Also, is the fee paid for directly by the DAA managers themselves, or is it taken from the portfolio's assets?
*Asked by @RayQuin*

> This fee is based on the percentage over 10% and is taken from the portfolio’s assets.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q10
Are there plans to remove or increase the max amount users can buy/sell on the platform per day? It seems weird that the fiat gateway will start by only letting users deposit a minimum of 50k, but they can only buy 10k of DAAs a day?
*Asked by @stephen*

> Yes, we plan to continue increasing these limits, but we can’t provide any exact dates at this time.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q11
What are iconomi's targets for number of users for end of q2, q3 and q4?
*Asked by @stephen*

> We are not disclosing internal targets at this time, especially not short-term targets, which can change very quickly.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q12
is this timeline still accurate? "The DAA creation and rebalancing fees will be introduced in May, together with a suite of back-end features related to these aspects of the platform. DAA tokenization fees will be introduced in April, and the adjusted buyback system will take effect on July 1."
*Asked by @elly*

> Automated rebalancing depends on the automated rebalancing form, which has been delayed. DAA creation fees have already been introduced, beginning with yesterday's launch of the TEA DAA, and tokenization fees have been in place since April. The adjusted buyback system is still scheduled to be implemented on July 1.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q13
Iconomi owns both the .net and .com domain. Often times larger companies will tend to use the .com domain as it's considered slightly more reputable (at least in the USA). What was/is the reasoning for using the .net domain and is there any consideration to forward traffic to the .com domain in the future?
*Asked by @stephen*

> The "iconomi.com" domain was taken at the time of launch but has since been acquired, and defaulting to the .com domain is an option we're considering for the future.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q14
With the fiat gateway OTC deal being made, and several users wanting to use it in the future. Could you tell us something about the average OTC amount people want to transfer? And does this money come from individual users or rather from institutional users?
*Asked by @martijn*

> The average amount people are asking to transfer is about $50k. We have had interest from both individual and institutional users, but individual users are the dominant category so far.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q15
Someone recently noted that the BMC DAA seems to be inactive (no communications and rebalances for a while). Can you comment on this, and on what happens if managers become inactive or want to dissolve their DAA?
*Asked by @UncleJun*

> We have procedures in place for closing a DAA if necessary. Essentially, if a DAA is closed, ICONOMI will sell off its assets and distribute them to the DAA holders. We will explain the procedure for closing a DAA in a future blog post.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q16 (follow-on from Q15)
If a DAA is not tokenized, the process should be simple, the underlying assets are sold and the users get their investment back. in what? Would we have a choice? (Fiat, stable coin, BTC, ETH)
But I'm curious to know the process if it's a tokenized DAA. For how long can ICONOMI convert tokens from a DAA that no longer exists?
*Asked by @CRYPTODEAL*

> For untokenized DAAs, holders will receive BTC or ETH.
> For tokenized DAAs, there are two possibilities. 1. For tokens held on the platform, the process will be the same as for untokenized DAAs. 2. For tokens held outside the platform, we will contact holders of the relevant DAA to inform them of the situation and post detailed instructions and announcements on all of our social media channels. There will be a generous time limit, after which the situation will be handled similarly to what happens in the traditional stock market when a shareholder does not claim dividends, and any unclaimed assets will go to ICONOMI.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q17
In the last months/year there has been a move to hide certain aspects of Iconomi from the general public (AMA moved from reddit to the chat, all the content from Columbus-Capitals website removed, no whitepaper on the site or any mention about the original aspects of Iconomi regarding the Iconomi token and the ICO that funded the company and many things more). Was this done to make legal actions against Iconomi harder? What is the strategy behind it?
*Asked by @mons*

> We're trying different communication strategies to find the best fit for our community. The AMA here on Rocket.Chat remains publicly viewable. For any questions about Columbus Capital, we recommend contacting them directly. The whitepaper is now several years old; we believe there is enough information elsewhere to understand ICONOMI, what it is, and how it works, and we are focused on continuing to grow the company.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q18
Would Iconomi ever implement dividends for ICN holders in future when there are more regulations from regulators like the SEC?
*Asked by @harillien*

> All options are open, but this is something we can consider once the regulatory framework is established.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q19
Last year, in an interview, I believe it was the ceo Tim who said that iconomi was getting ready for ramping up to 200 employees. Is iconomi still planning to have around that number of employees this year? What departments are expected to see the biggest growth in number of employees?
*Asked by @stephen*

> We are continuing to onboard new employees and definitely want to see our team grow to a three-digit number in the future, but we don't have a specific number of employees in mind. The biggest growth has been and will continue to be in the development department, and we also expect the marketing department to grow significantly.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q20
Does iconomi plan to have their api ready for trading by end of q3?
*Asked by @stephen*

> Yes, this is still the plan, but it does depend on the market situation, which can sometimes change our list of priorities.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q21
"Rebalancing is mostly an automated process; the only manual aspect is the requirement for DAA managers to provide their proposed structure to ICONOMI for rebalancing. At this stage, we are monitoring the rebalancing algorithm to ensure it continues working as it should, and the entire process will be automated in Q2."
This was announced in the March AMA. Is it still a goal that will be hit in Q2?
*Asked by @mons*

> Automated rebalancing depends on the upgrade of our trading engine, which has been slightly delayed. We'll provide an update on the trading engine in our next quarterly development report, which will be released on Thursday, June 21. Because of this delay, automated rebalancing will also be delayed by approximately one month.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q22
As Iconomi conclude their 10 assets in 10 days campaign, they announced NEO as the final asset. I don't know about any of the other DAssets - I think Stellar has some inflation thing, but I don't know how it works - but NEO generates another valuable asset, Gas. Does Iconomi's storage situation allow for the GAS generated by the NEO they hold to be claimed? How will this work when the NEO is held in DAA's/what will Iconomi do with the Gas?
*Asked by RayQuin*

> We will support tokens like GAS, airdrops, and similar digital assets if their market value makes the effort worthwhile for users, managers, and our development team. Typically this will mean any such tokens collected will be sold and distributed proportionally across the structure of the relevant DAAs (similarly to how we handled Bitcoin Gold: https://medium.com/iconominet/official-statement-on-the-bitcoin-gold-hard-fork-372ebf98913c).
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q23
Are there questions you are surprised that they haven't been asked yet?
*Asked by @mons*

> We really like questions about the platform and our service, or just random questions like what we eat for breakfast :) We can get a bit more creative with questions like that. We take all our communication channels very seriously and strive to have a professional approach when communicating with our supporters, but we are a company built by a younger generation and we like to have fun too.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q24
Are you thinking of adding some SEO positioning to your web page?
*Asked by @jmelchor*

> Yes, this is something we are already working on and will be implemented shortly.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q25
I see that at new DAAS there are also entry and exit fee larger than 0.5%. Can "old" DAAs also change that fee? and is that fee also 70% goes to DAA manager and 30% for buyback?
I know that original 0.5% exit fees go for withdrawl expenses.
*Asked by @Jean_Alesi*

>Yes, any DAA can change the entry and exit fees, and the 70/30 split between managers and buybacks still holds.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q26
It was said in the roadmap for 2018 that marketing efforts would step up from Q3, in tandem with the website redesign. Also I understand that a specialist agency has been working with you on marketing. If these things have been decided yet: 

1. Are you moving beyond the word of mouth approach, if so, what kind of marketing approach/es are being used?
2. Are you encountering any legal difficulties in advertising crypto investments generally, or are you aware of specific Maltese (or other) restrictions that will affect your efforts?
3. Are you taking any steps to market or promote the usage of the ICN token along with the general Iconomi platform?
4. Are you encountering any legal difficulties in advertising the ICN token specifically, or are you aware of specific Maltese (or other) restrictions that will affect your efforts?

*Asked by @RayQuin*

> The word of mouth approach was one of the most effective marketing strategies for 2016/17 in the blockchain industry as a whole. Since then, our marketing and communication strategy has changed tremendously and evolved into a strategy that takes into account several different verticals/target groups as well as geographical specifics. For the last six months, we have been building important connections in the crypto-economy and have started organizing events where we and our DAA managers can connect with important influencers in crypto as well as in the traditional financial industry. We are also attending different conferences and events where we are able to actively promote our platform and introduce it to a new audience. Our PR activities are a constant companion to our major milestones and other communications.

> Just like other blockchain-based companies, we are aware of the current lack of a regulatory framework in the crypto-economy and are proactively pursuing and are in talks with regulators, both domestic and foreign. We are making sure our marketing and advertising activities are in line with the current state of regulation, which is the only way to create a stable foundation for the future of the company. We are in this for the long term, and our marketing activities will resonate with that mission.

*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q27
In the past weeks we have seen great development progress from ICONOMI, great milestones have been reached. Platform is evolving in right direction, but we investors, community and even ICONOMI thinks ICN is undervalued (stating this because that's why you said tresoury bought 2.5M ICN tokens in first place). In past weeks platform development made huge breakthroughs but on other hand ICN is moving nowhere. 

Platform is working, huge development breakthroughs, but investors just see no benefit out of that. *Do you really think you are doing everything in your power to satisfy your investors?*
*Asked by @investmox*

> Yes. We are completely devoted to creating a platform that will serve as the main entry point for anyone who wants to enter the crypto-economy. This is what we believe will ultimately satisfy everyone, both ICN holders and users buying into other digital assets via our platform.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q28
Do you have any marketing and PR concept? Platform is ready, what are you waiting for to start getting known by average Joe?
*Asked by @chris_r99*

> Yes, and we are continuously adjusting it so it serves the current state of the market. Focusing on people who have not yet been introduced to the crypto-economy has been one of our priorities since Q1 2018 and will remain a priority. As communicated in our 2018 Overview (https://medium.com/iconominet/iconomi-in-2018-e9d01ee5159e), our next step is to redesign the website with this in mind.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q29
For what reasons does the Iconomi Team think the online-community is in the state it is in and is this a desired state, since there is no community building being done? (There is no activity on reddit and only a handful of people active in the chat. Most of the old community members have left.)
*Asked by @mons*

> We do want to build a strong online community, and we appreciate all the community members who are here today and who have helped us get to this point. We think every blockchain-based company experiences a natural evolution of community: first adopters, finding a suitable community chat service, etc. We believe this is an ongoing process because it is driven by real people, and real people have different personal opinions and beliefs, so they react to news and other announcements differently. Though we have always strived to adjust our communication channels to the needs of our community members, we know some of our decisions will not always be welcomed at first. It might sound like a cliche but the only constant in life is change.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q30
Will Iconomi pursue getting a broker-dealer license (B-D), an alternative trading system license (ATS), and a registered investment advisor (RIA) license so they can offer services in the USA?
*Asked by @stephen*

> As we see the industry moving more and more toward regulation, especially exchanges, we know that the fully regulated players in this field will be the ones who will take the largest market share in the future. ICONOMI is also part of this movement, and we are working hard at having the platform regulated as a whole. The current focus is on the EU, where good progress has been made, though it is too early to disclose more. Achieving market penetration in the USA is not part of our short-term plans, though we fully understand the importance of this market and it is definitely part of our roadmap for the future.
*Answered June 19th 2018*

# Q31
Starting July 1, 2018, DAA management fees will be collected and converted to ICN on a daily basis. Will CCP profits also be converted to ICN on a daily basis in the same quarter they're realised in or will things remain as they are at present (where CCP profits in any given quarter are used for buybacks during the next quarter)?
*Asked by @jesusthatsgreat*

> No, CCP profits will still be calculated on a quarterly basis.
*Answered June 29th 2018*

# Q32
As is normal in IT development there should be a moment to think what would improve the workings of the team (retrospective). Which improvements did you come up with for the past months?
 *Asked by @martijn*

> Improving internal communication is something that always leads to tangible results and something we are constantly striving to improve. However, most of our energy in this area is currently focused on streamlining our process for onboarding new dev team members so they can be productive as soon as possible.
*Answered 29th June 2018*

# Q33
Coinbase has recently made some moves towards positioning itself well for what some experts believe is a coming security token bull run. How is iconomi positioning itself from a regulatory perspective for handling security tokens? How does the iconomi team see the crypto market unfolding in the coming months and years in regards to security tokens?
*Asked by @stephen*

> ICONOMI is working on regulating the platform, which includes the entire scope of necessary licenses and registrations, including for security tokens, such as equity tokens or similar. We are closely monitoring regulatory developments in several jurisdictions and are actively preparing to enter all markets and apply for any and all licenses as required or appropriate to operate the platform as a fully licensed activity. The crypto market will become more and more complex in the future, as regulation will apply not only to utility tokens, but also to security tokens. We firmly believe that this technology will bring a massive paradigm shift to the securities market in the form of the tokenization of securities and other assets. The individual building blocks of the platform are already future-proof in this regard.
*Answered June 29th 2018*

# Q34
Why isn't there any mention of the ICN Token on Iconomi's Homepage? Not even on the About Us page. I believe that you owe it to your Supporters/Investors who bought the ICO that there is a clear explanation on how Iconomi was funded in the first place and the value the ICN Token represents.
*Asked by @mons*

> We will have a separate dedicated page on ICN on our website that will combine all relevant information relating to the ICN token.
*Answered June 29th 2018*


# Q35
As you mentioned, the marketing department is growing and you are working with other partners on your marketing strategy. Can you explain what type of marketing actions are you planning for the upcoming quarters in order to get more user growth and expand the platform?
*Asked by @stricken03*

> We are looking for new people to join our marketing department. We just opened a new position for a marketing assistant (see our open position/jobs section), for example. In upcoming quarters, we will be more active in direct marketing with a strong focus on quality content and education. We will publish more details in the Q2 Financial Report.
*Answered July 5th 2018*
  

# Q36
When will Iconomi begin recognizing the value of a strong community and start taking the steps to grow one?
*Asked by @stephen*

> We understand how important a strong community is and truly appreciate the community we have so far. We have constantly adapted our channels to better serve our community and the changing environment in the blockchain industry. We will continue to do so in the future as well, and we strive to implement community requests and wishes (like opening this channel on Rocket.Chat). Together with our strong focus on building the overall ICONOMI brand, this will in the long run create an informative environment and a strong bond for our community and for newcomers to blockchain.
*Answered July 5th 2018*

# Q37
Does iconomi understand the importance of user growth and getting AUM up on the platform? What is iconomi planning to do short and long term to grow these numbers. Who is iconomi’s target customer? On a scale from 1-10 how aggressively will iconomi be focusing on increasing user and aum numbers up in 2018?
*Asked by @stephen*

> Of course we understand the importance of user growth and growing AUM, and we are constantly working to improve these numbers. What really builds a long-term and, most importantly, loyal client base is a thorough understanding of the market's needs. This way, you are creating a product and service that not only satisfies your customers' needs but also contributes to the industry as a whole. We cannot reveal our full strategy and specific target group details because much of it is sensitive information in this very competitive and growing market. We can share that one of the biggest target groups with the most potential is definitely people who have not yet been introduced to blockchain and the crypto-economy, and future marketing efforts will lean in this direction accordingly.
*Answered July 5th 2018*

# Q38
I was pretty sure you will be more aggressive in marketing once fiat gateway is here. In google trends, word "iconomi" is at zero level which means nobody googles it and nobody knows about the company. In google news, when I try to find something about iconomi then it shows me only some automatically generated reports about the price of ICN. In reddit, "iconomi" mentioned only in /r/iconomi and in threads created by the community. Moreover, your homepage does not have a single mention that it is possible to buy DAAs with EUR. It looks like your current marketing strategy ignores the end users. When your marketing strategy will stop ignoring the end users? Which conditions must be satisfied for this? Will it happen when FGW is fully automated?
*Asked by @cherurg*

> As with any digital marketing strategy, SEO is integral to driving customers to a business. We are currently revising and will be updating/adjusting our SEO campaigns in the coming months to increase awareness of ICONOMI. We don't ignore the end users, and we use different strategies to introduce them to our platform. However, once the fiat gateway is fully automated, it will be much easier to target new users and promote the ease of use of our platform.
*Answered July 5th 2018*

# Q39
Will the new daily buyback process be either fully automated from the start or manually operated?
*Asked by @kwosh*

> While we will be checking a few things manually, the process is already nearly fully automated.
*Answered July 13th 2018*

# Q40
Is the upcoming ability for users to purchase individual crypto assets a precursor to Iconomi possibly becoming a regulated exchange in the future? I ask because it should help Iconomi increase revenue and cut down the costs of buying crypto assets from other exchanges.
*Asked by @harillen*

> Based on recent regulatory developments, mostly in the EU, ICONOMI does see a possibility for establishing a regulated exchange under the new regulatory frameworks.
*Answered July 13th 2018*

# Q41
Does Iconomi have a set plan or timetable for lowering the limits of the fiat gateway. If so, would it be possible for a rough approximation of the stages, or what the lowest limit will be, and roughly how long it will be before Iconomi reach this limit (even if it's just "late 2019" for example). If there is no firm plan, is Iconomi able to lower the gateway limits as and when they feel is best, or is this conditional on improvements made to the platform/backend, or external factors like your banking partner/s?
*Asked by @RayQuin*

> We plan to lower the requirements for using the fiat gateway this quarter. The minimum requirement will be very low, affordable for anyone using the ICONOMI platform.
*Answered July 13th 2018*

# Q42
Does iconomi dev team follow best practices such as unit testing and e2e testing?
*Asked by @stephen*

> We always try to follow best practices, including unit and E2E testing.
*Answered July 20th 2018*

# Q43
Soft question for you guys. How does the ICONOMI team have fun? Do you have office trips, go out for meals and how did you all celebrate milestones like the fiat gateway? a nice blogpost with pics of the team's happy smiling faces would be a nice feature as well as all the hard work.
*Asked by @RayQuin*

> We do a few things to have fun together as a company. Twice a week we have catered lunches at the office, we have group hikes, and last month we had a team picnic/kayaking trip. We set up events like this on a pretty regular basis. We don't usually have official celebrations for milestones, but last year we had a big party for our one-year anniversary, and we'll be having another one this year. We'll be sure to share some pictures.
*Answered July 20th 2018*

# Q44
Why did you only handout 20 caps for the giveaway? Having 20 caps for 50000 users is really low. I also think a cap could have maximum cost €5 which means this was a €100 marketing device = basically nothing. Why weren't there more caps being handed out?
*Asked by @martijn*

> This was our first promo contest, so we didn't want to go overboard before gauging how much interest there would be. We will have more contests in the future and increase the number of prizes.
*Answered July 20th 2018*

# Q45
Which items on the 2018 roadmap does the ICONOMI team feel are most at risk for being completed in 2018?
*Asked by @Stephen*

> While we are still actively working on implementing it, the ICONOMI debit card is something that may have to wait until 2019, since it's mostly dependent on cooperation with third-party companies. We’ve also seen the problems some card-based projects have had in the past and want to be careful to avoid them.
*Answered July 27th 2018*

 
# Q46
I noticed when looking through the cumulative audit report that aside from Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Cash held by users, Iconomi have 3500 Bitcoin Gold, and 2100 Litecoin. As far as I remember Iconomi do not support these assets in DAA’s. Does Iconomi have a plan to do anything with these assets, and also does Iconomi have a plan to deal with assets owned by DAA’s which come from chain forks in the future.
*Asked by @RayQuin*

> Bitcoin Gold is a supported fork and was attributed to users and DAAs. Any amounts left have either not been sold off yet or were withdrawn from the platform. Bitcoin Gold cannot be included in DAAs. You can find more information about how we handle hard forks in our statement on the bitcoin gold hard fork: [Official Statement.](https://medium.com/iconominet/official-statement-on-the-bitcoin-gold-hard-fork-372ebf98913c) 
*Answered July 27th 2018*

# Q47
Is there transparency over the ICONOMI team's own ICN holdings? Are we able to see sales/balances?
*Asked by @AdioFrog*

> No, for privacy and security reasons, team members’ ICN holdings will not be disclosed.
*Answered July 27th 2018*
