# Iconomi
Iconomi is a blockchain-based platform that enables anyone to invest in cryptocurrency index funds or create and manage their own cryptocurrency index fund. These index funds are called *Digital Asset Arrays (DAAs)* hence the reason Iconomi formerly refer to their platform as a 'Digital Asset Management Platform'.

Instead of manually creating a crypto portfolio made up of several coins (which often can't be acquired, managed and stored easily and securely), Iconomi users can choose between a wide variety of Digital Asset Arrays on Iconomi. There are currently 24 DAAs which anyone can invest in and this number is growing constantly.

Investing in a DAA (or multiple DAAs) removes the need for a user to design and rebalance a portfolio, to store digital assets securely, and to use cryptocurrency exchanges to buy and sell coins. 

# History
The company was founded by Tim M. Zagar and Jani Valjavec who previously founded Cashila, the first licensed bitcoin company in the world. Iconomi held their ICO on 25 August 2016 and it ran until 29 September 2016, raising a total USD amount of $10,682,516.42. 

# Team
In December 2017 ICONOMI had 36 employees and this number is expected to grow significantly in 2018 and beyond. Iconomi's headquarters are located in Ljubljana, Slovenia.
