# ICONOMI
ICONOMI is a platform that deals in digital assets that enables anyone to invest in cryptocurrency index funds or create and manage their own cryptocurrency index fund. These index funds are called *Digital Asset Arrays(DAAs)* hence the reason ICONOMI formerly refer to their platform as a 'Digital Asset Management Platform'.

Without using a service such as ICONOMI, creating a crypto portfolio made up of several assets can be time consuming, risky and requires technical understanding of how certain assets operate. 

Using ICONOMI, users can choose to invest in a growing number of existing DAAs. In doing so, this removes the need for the user to design and rebalance a portfolio, store assets securely and register with multiple exchanges. 

## History
