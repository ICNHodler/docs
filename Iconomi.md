# Iconomi
Iconomi is a blockchain-based platform that enables anyone to invest in cryptocurrency index funds or create and manage their own cryptocurrency index fund. These index funds are called *Digital Asset Arrays (DAAs)* hence the reason Iconomi formerly refer to their platform as a 'Digital Asset Management Platform'.

Without using a service such as Iconomi, creating a crypto portfolio made up of several assets can be time consuming, risky and require technical understanding of how certain assets operate. 

Using Iconomi, users can choose to invest in a growing number of existing Digital Asset Arrays. In doing so, this removes the need for a user to design and rebalance a portfolio, store assets securely and register with multiple exchanges. 

## History
The company was founded by Tim M. Zagar and Jani Valjavec who previously founded Cashila, the first licensed bitcoin company in the world. Iconomi held their ICO on 25 August 2016 and it ran until 29 September 2016, raising a total USD amount of $10,682,516.42. 

## Team
