# Digital Portfolios
Digital Portfolios are the foundation of the [ICONOMI](ICONOMI.md) platform. They're essentially cryptocurrency investment funds comprised of cryptocurrency coins and tokens, with each Portfolio generally taking a different approach or perspective on the market.

At the time of writing there are currently 35 public Digital Portfolios which anyone can invest in. Each Digital Portfolio has a manager which can be an individual or team, with various backgrounds and experience in both crypto and financial markets. The Iconomi platform also supports private Digital Portfolios, which are not displayed on the public dashboard, or available for public investment. 

An example of a Digital Portfolio is the [Blockchain Index (BLX)](DAAs/BLX.md) managed by ICONOMI themselves. It is ICONOMI's flagship Digital Portfolio, and is intended to function as a market index. 

# Digital Portfolio Creation
Eventually, all users will be able to create and manage their own Digital Portfolio, but an implementation date for this hasn't yet been specified. Currently, in order to create a Digital Portfolio, a manager must supply seed capital. 

Up until 2019, for seed amounts of between $50,000 and $100,000, a fee of 2000 ICN was required. For seed amounts of between $100,000 and $250,000, a 1500 ICN fee was required. Managers who supplied seed capital of $250,000 or more did not pay an ICN fee. Up until March 2018, a minimum seed of $100,000 was required and there was no ICN fee.

In addition to seed capital, a Digital Portfolio manager is vetted by and must convince ICONOMI that they have a unique strategy and have the knowledge and skills to be trusted enough to manage other people's money. Applications can be made to sales@iconomi.com. 

# Digital Portfolio Tokenization
In April 2018, a fee of 2,000 was introduced for tokenization. This enables a Digital Portfolio to have its own ERC20 token which can then be transferred freely to or from the [ICONOMI](ICONOMI.md) platform to any Ethereum address, into cold storage or between individuals. 

The Digital Portfolios [BLX](DAAs/BLX.md), [GEM](DAAs/GEM.md) and [CCC](DAAs/CCC.md) have so far been tokenized. They may be bought or sold on exchanges on the open market. US citizens can't currently register on the Iconomi platform so buying Digital Portfolios on 3rd party exchanges is the only way they can invest directly in Digital Portfolio.

# Digital Portfolio Rebalancing
Digital Portfolio managers initially allocate a fixed percentage weight to all of their assets. Over time, as the price of individual assets change, the relative percentage weight of the array may end up varying greatly. For example if a Digital Portfolio is comprised of 50% BTC and 50% ETH and the price of ETH rises 20%, the weights will now be 40% BTC an 60% ETH. Rebalancing simply buys and sells individual assets so that weights are reset to the Digital Portfolio managers target percentage. Most managers currently rebalance monthly. 

# Digital Portfolio Management Fees
Managers are paid in the token of the Digital Portfolio they manage. Digital Portfolio management fees reward Digital Portfolio managers and incentivise them to manage and promote their Digital Portfolios. These are annual fees and can be specified by the Digital Portfolio manager (between 1% and 10%). Of this number, ICONOMI get a 30% cut, and managers retain 70%. The fees are charged daily from the AUM of the Digital Portfolio i.e. if a management fee is 2%, then the calculation for daily fees is 2%/365 = .00547% per day. 

Rebalancing up to a 10% change in assets under management (AUM) per month is free. Rebalancing over the 10% threshold incurs a fee of 0.1% on the AUM over the threshold. For example if a Digital Portfolio has $1m AUM, and rebalances in a month total $90k, there are no costs. If rebalances total $120k in a month, a 0.1% fee is charge on $20k.
