# ICN Token
The ICN token has properties that make it both a utility and a security token. All available ICN represents 100% ownership of ICONOMI including the ICONOMI platform and all of its assets. As a result of that ownership, ICN will enable holders to participate in ICONOMI service operator voting. The service operator is the team running ICONOMI operations. More details on voting will come in Q3 2018.

100m ICN were issued after the ICONOMI ICO in 2016. 85m went to the ICO participants and 2m were used for early-stage marketing and bounties. Of the remaining 13m ICN, 2m tokens were distributed to advisors, 8m went to the ICONOMI team and 3m were reserved for future team members. The 8m tokens distributed to the team are vested over 2 years. Of these, a quarter are distributed every 6 months. By October 2018, all ICN allocated to the team will be fully vested.

ICN is a deflationary token due to ICONOMI's repayment program. Starting July 1 2018, this will change to a new rolling buyback system. Prior to July 2018, fees were collected continuously, and used for buybacks at the end of each operating quarter. From July 2018, ICONOMI will implement a system to buy ICN tokens on a rolling basis, in tandem with fees being collected. 

# Fee Generating Events:
- Management Fee. [DAAs](../Digital-Asset-Arrays.md) collect annual management fees. 30% of this fee goes towards buybacks. The manager receives the remainder.
    - [BLX](../BLX.md) has a 3% annual management fee, all of which goes towards buybacks.
    - When [CCP](../CCP.md) sells assets, 20% of profits go towards buybacks - the rest is reinvested into the fund.
- Seeding and creation of DAAs. The larger the seed amount, the smaller the fee. From 2000 ICN to free.
- Tokenisation Fee. ICONOMI charge managers a 2000 ICN fee to create an ERC-20 token for their DAA.
- Rebalancing Fee. ICONOMI charge managers if they rebalance above 10% of their DAA's AUM in a single month. 0.1% is charged on the amount over 10% that is rebalanced.

The bought back ICN is sent to a burn address, a smart contract without a withdraw option. There are currently around 843,000 ICN burnt.

In addition to the repayment program, ICONOMI can buy ICN for its treasury. They will do this when there is a significant difference in the book value of ICONOMI and the ICN token's market value. The treasury can also sell the ICN when the opposite occurs and the market value of ICN greatly exceeds book value to the point where ICONOMI deem it to be irrationally exuberant. The ICN in the treasury will not hold voting rights.

ICONOMI may add further uses for the token as the platform develops and regulation matures.
