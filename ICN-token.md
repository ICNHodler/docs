# ICN Token
ICN is an ERC20 token which represents ownership of the ICONOMI and has various utility usages on the ICONOMI platform. 100m ICN were issued after the ICONOMI ICO in 2016. 85m went to the ICO participants and 2m were used for early-stage marketing and bounties. Of the remaining 13m ICN, 2m tokens were distributed to advisors, 8m went to the ICONOMI team and 3m were reserved for future team members. The 8m tokens distributed to the team are vested over 2 years. Of these, a quarter of all tokens are distributed every 6 months. By October 2018, all of the ICN allocated to the team will be fully vested.

The ICN token has properties that make it both a utility and a security token. It represents 100% ownership of ICONOMI including the ICONOMI platform and all of ICONOMI's assets. As a result of that ownership, ICN will enable holders to participate in ICONOMI service operator voting. The service operator is the team running ICONOMI operations. More details on voting will come in Q3 2018.

ICN is a deflationary token due to ICONOMI's repayment program. Starting July 1 2018, this will change to a new buyback system.
There are several ways in which ICN will be bought back and burned:
- DAAs collect management fees. 30% of these fees go towards buybacks.
- BLX has a 3% management fee, all of which go towards buybacks.
- When CCP sells assets, 20% of profits go towards buybacks.
- Fee for the creation of DAAs. The larger the seed amount, the smaller the fee. From 2000 ICN to free.
- 0.1% rebalancing fee on the amount of AUM rebalanced above 10% AUM. 
- Tokenization fee of 2000 ICN

The bought back ICN gets sent to a burn-address just before quarterly reports are released. The address is tied to a smart contract without a withdraw option. There are currently almost 265,000 ICN in this burn address.

In addition to the repayment program, ICONOMI can buy ICN for its treasury. They will do this when there is a significant difference in the book value of ICONOMI and ICNs market value. The treasury can also sell the ICN when the opposite occurs and the market value of ICN greatly exceeds book value to the point where Iconomi deem it to be irrationally exuberant. The ICN in the treasury will not hold voting rights.
