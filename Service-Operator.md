The purpose of this file is to document all communication from ICONOMI regarding what they call a 'service operator' who are an entity tasked with operating the ICONOMI platform. In the future, it's expected that ICN token holders will be able to vote for service operators and this document is designed to be a useful reference for the community when speculating / debating about what may or may not happen and how things may or may not work.

# Feb 2018 - Reddit Thread titled "Voting rights and Treasury"
> We initially discussed voting rights in our whitepaper prior to our ICO, and implementation of these rights will be an important milestone for ICONOMI. Whilst it is too early to fully determine all aspects and properties of voting rights, the driving factor in determining these rules will be simple: we will do whatever is fair and right for our users. Of course we will inform our users when all the major elements of the voting system have been defined. Taking this into account, as well as feedback from our community, we want to clarify that the treasury tokens will have no voting rights.

Q. Hello ICONOMI team. Great work so far on the platform, but we investors in ICN sometimes get the felling that you are neglecting ICN token a little. We get questions "what gives ICN value" or "why would I even buy ICN token since it's got no use" on this subreddit almost every day. How would you anwser that question and how do you see ICN moving forward in 2018 and beyond

> A. Hello lakopy. The parameters of the ICN token have not changed since the ICO and remain as promised in the original whitepaper and explained in several AMAs and blog posts. The buyback program and the vote on the service operator are the direct implementations of the whitepaper promise. We have also gone forward with the utility of the ICN token, as previously explained. What made us one of the most successful projects in 2016 continues to hold true in 2017 and will continue to hold true in 2018.

Q. what is the road map with dates for ICN ?

> A. Hello midoprince. Thanks for your question. As ICN is burned every quarter, the next ICN burn will happen at the beginning of October. The next major milestone for ICN will be voting, which will happen in October 2018. More details about voting will be available in Q3 2018. We are also, of course, developing the utility functions of ICN.

# Sep 2016 - Legal Part 1 Medium Blog Post
> ..there is no possibility of tracking or even mirroring ICN shareholding structure directly at this time. We believe this will soon change and we will restructure ICONOMI accordingly immediately.

> In the meantime, ICONOMI is forced to exist in duality, with a service operator as an intermediary, who indirectly enables ICONOMI to manifest its actions through it. The ICONOMI whitepaper states: "Cashila OOD s.r.o. […] will serve as the first service operator of the ICONOMI platform."

> At this point I would like to clarify that for the sake of complete transparency and clear-cut separation, ICONOMI will seek its own juridical personality — Cashila OOD s.r.o. will only be providing a part of its substratum (economic element) to ICONOMI during the time it acts as a service operator, but not its legal personality (legal element). The partial substratum of Cashila OOD s.r.o., joined by additional elements (people, intellectual property and capital, for instance) will together form the substance of ICONOMI, which will acquire its own legal personality. Should the service operator be replaced at any time, its part (for example: people) in ICONOMI shall be replaced, while the rest (for example: capital, intellectual property) continue to exist unobstructed.

> Logically, should the service operator be replaced, there is no external change in ownership to be performed. The foundation is assigned new management, according to a vote among ICN token holders.

Q. How much is distributed as dividends to ICN token holders?

>A. ICN token holders receive everything, after the operational costs of the service operator have been subtracted.

# ICONOMI Service Operator as per original whitepaper description - July 2016
> The service operator of the ICONOMI platform provides a way of materialising the actions of the autonomous ICONOMI platform. In the same way that a juridical personality manifests its actions through its authorised natural persons, the ICONOMI platforms establishes its relationships with other juridical persons, natural persons and government entities through the at-the-time elected service operator.

> Cashila OOD s.r.o. (hereinafter referred to as "Cashila") will serve as the first service operator of the ICONOMI platform. Having at its disposal the required knowledge, technical skills and manpower, as well as the status of a financial institution and a longstanding
relationship with both the crypto and investment communities, Cashila will undertake to develop and manage the ICONOMI platform in accordance with the vision outlined in this white paper and detailed in the accompanying documentation on behalf of the ICN token holders. Cashila does not and will not claim or register any kind of property, trademark or other rights pertaining to the ICONOMI platform. All intellectual property rights, trademarks, branding and other rights remain exclusively the property of the ICONOMI platform. 

> Cashila will develop and organise the ICONOMI ICO campaign on behalf of the ICONOMI platform. Cashila will develop and manage the ICONOMI platform as the first service operator. Although a profit-sharing scheme between the ICONOMI platform and its service operator is intended to be exercised, Cashila will not participate in profit-sharing at least until such time that the capital raised during the ICONOMI ICO covers the operational costs of Cashila.

> ICN ownership entitles its possessor to participate in ICONOMI platform related voting. One of the most important voting issues will be the selection of service operators. ICN holders are free to vote on a service operator at any time after the ICONOMI platform has been launched, but not before a 24-month moratorium has passed.
