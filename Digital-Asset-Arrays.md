# Digital Asset Arrays
Digital Asset Arrays (DAAs) are the foundation of the Iconomi platform. They're essentially cryptocurrency Index funds - funds comprised of various combinations of cryptocurrency coins and tokens.

At the time of writing there are currently 24 public DAAs which anyone can invest in. Each DAA has a manager which can be an individual or team with various backgrounds and experience in both crypto and financial markets. 

An example of a DAA is the Blockchain Index (BLX) managed by Columbus Capital. It is comprised of approximately 15% Bitcoin, 15% Ethereum, 13% Dash, 10% Monero and various other coins and tokens. It has a management fee of 3% per year meaning and an exit fee of 0.5% (this is the standard exit fee for all DAAs). 

BLX is tokenised meaning it can be transferred to and from Iconomi in to cold storage or on to exchanges. It can be bought / sold on exchanges but only at the price people are willing to pay. US citizens can't currently register on the Iconomi platform so buying DAAs on 3rd party exchanges is the only way they can invest in DAAs. 

Columbus Capital Pinta (CCP) is a closed DAA managed by Columbus Capital which can only be invested in by holding ICN tokens (the ICN token represents ownership of the fund).
