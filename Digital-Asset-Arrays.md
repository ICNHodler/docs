# Digital Asset Arrays
Digital Asset Arrays (DAAs) are the foundation of the [ICONOMI](ICONOMI.md) platform. They're essentially cryptocurrency Index funds - funds comprised of various combinations of cryptocurrency coins and tokens.

At the time of writing there are currently 24 public DAAs which anyone can invest in. Each DAA has a manager which can be an individual or team with various backgrounds and experience in both crypto and financial markets. 

An example of a DAA is the [Blockchain Index (BLX)](DAAs/BLX.md) managed by [Columbus Capital](Columbus-Capital.md). It consists of approximately 15% Bitcoin, 15% Ethereum, 13% Dash, 10% Monero and various other coins and tokens. It has a management fee of 3% per year and an exit fee of 0.5% (this is the standard exit fee for all DAAs). 

[BLX](DAAs/BLX.md) is tokenized as an ERC20-token, meaning it can be transferred to and from [ICONOMI](ICONOMI.md) in to cold storage or on to exchanges. It can be bought/sold on exchanges but only at the price people are willing to pay. US citizens can't currently register on the Iconomi platform so buying DAAs on 3rd party exchanges is the only way they can invest in DAAs. 

Other DAAs can have higher or lower management fees and not all DAAs have been tokenised.

[Columbus Capital Pinta (CCP)](DAAs/CCP.md) is a closed DAA managed by [Columbus Capital](Columbus-Capital.md) which can only be invested in by holding ICN tokens (the ICN token represents ownership of the fund).

# DAA Creation
In order to create a DAA, you need a minimum seed amount of $50,000. There is also a 2000 ICN fee for seeds between $50k-100k or a 1500 ICN fee for seeds between $100k-$250k. Managers who seed $250k or more do not pay an ICN fee. Up until March 2018, a minimum seed of $100k was required and there was no ICN fee invovled.

# DAA Tokenization
From March 2018 on, there is a 2,000 ICN fee for tokenization. This enables a DAA to have its own ERC20 token which can then be transferred freely to/from [ICONOMI](ICONOMI.md) or between individuals without having to use the [ICONOMI](ICONOMI.md) platform.
