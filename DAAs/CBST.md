# DAA Strategy
> The Coinbest I DAA will follow a conservative strategy, with a high percentage of our portfolio invested in the most liquid and highest capitalization assets. Regular rebalancing will be performed monthly, and additional rebalancing will be triggered if the sum of BTC and ETH (prevailing "blue chips") falls from 50% weight. The invested amount of a particular asset should not exceed its daily trade volume, avoiding the volatility derived from low liquidity. The maximum number of included assets in the DAA is fifteen, because we consider it necessary for the DAA to be constantly monitored by our analysts. Assets will be added based only on fundamental analysis and long-term potential.
