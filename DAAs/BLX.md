# Blockchain Index (BLX)
Blockchain Index (BLX) is a DAA managed by [Columbus Capital](../Columbus-Capital.md). It currently contains 29 assets varying in weight from 15% to 0.15%. Annual management fee is 3%.

BLX was the first DAA on the [ICONOMI](../ICONOMI.md) platform and was created in December 2016. Only ICONOMI ICO participants could invest in it until the ICONOMI platform opened to the general public in August 2017. In August 2017, BLX was tokenised, becoming the first DAA to have its own ERC20 token. This meant BLX could be freely traded and stored outside of the ICONOMI platform. 

To date BLX has been the largest DAA measured by assets under management (AUM). In December 2017, BLX had over 3,500 investors with a total AUM of over $16m [[source]](https://medium.com/@columbuscapital/blockchain-index-update-deeab4425bf).

# DAA Strategy
> Weighting is based on market cap and the logarithm of market cap value in cases where assets have a proportionally higher market cap. The average daily volume of an individual asset in the past seven days must be at least double the invested value in the portfolio. The invested amount of a particular asset should not exceed 5% of its market capitalization. There is no maximum number of included assets in the index; they are added based on fundamental analysis and potential strategic importance in the future distributed economy. Regular rebalancing is done monthly, and additional rebalancing is triggered if an individual asset surpasses 25% weight.
