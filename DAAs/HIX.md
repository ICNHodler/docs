# Hive Index (HIX)
HIX is a [Digital Asset Array](../Digital-Asset-Arrays.md) managed by Hive Digital Assets which was founded in 2018 by Malcolm Cannon & Sudhir Kumar who bring a mixed background of old-world finance and start-up experience. HIX currently contains 25 assets equally weighted at 4%. Annual management fee is 1.8%.

# DAA Strategy
> The Hive Index holds the top 25 digital assets on the ICONOMI platform ranked by the combined dollar holdings of each asset in all other Digital Asset Arrays (DAAs). DAAs with more money invested in them and DAAs that have grown thanks to the increase in value of their underlying assets have proportionately higher influence on our portfolio. Due to the impressive historical performance of equal-weighted strategies, we assign each of the top 25 assets on the platform an equal share in our DAA. If an asset doubles in dollar value, we sell half the position and redistribute the gains. The DAA is rebalanced back to 4% for each digital asset on a monthly basis, and assets will be added and removed every quarter in order to reflect the changing sentiment of the crowd.
