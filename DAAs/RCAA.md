# DAA Strategy
> The strategy of the DAA is comprised of three main elements. The first element is keeping RCAA holders safe, meaning a significant amount of the allocation will always be held in mature and established assets with low volatility and high liquidity. The second element is all about researching and diversifying our portfolio into undervalued but fundamentally strong projects. The last element consists of finding the right exit points. Because perfect market timing is unlikely in the long run, we intend to minimize risks by selling certain positions with every rise and rebalancing the portfolio accordingly.
