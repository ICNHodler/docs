# DAA Strategy
> The GCO DAA portfolio is built on a unique selection strategy. Projects are chosen from a typical venture capital perspective. Similarities to the evolution of the internet are used to identify projects with relatively higher probabilities of success. All chosen projects must have a realistic chance of success. Given the early stage of the sector, we prefer currency and platform tokens over (industry-specific) utility tokens. The risk profile is relatively low to medium. The minimum position size is 1% of the total portfolio, and GCO will target roughly thirty different assets.
