# StrongCoindex (SCX)
SCX is a [Digital Asset Array](../Digital-Asset-Arrays.md) managed by StrongCoindex who are a Dutch investment club that believe in blockchain and its great potential. SCX currently contains 20 assets of equal 5% weights. Annual management fee is 3%.

# DAA Strategy
> With bitcoin's dominance of the total cryptocurrency market cap dropping, StrongCoindex has opted for an equally weighted DAA. This means that each asset has an equal share in the overall portfolio. Aside from regular monthly rebalancing, additional rebalancing is triggered whenever an individual asset's share of the portfolio surpasses 15%. Rebalancing will select the 19 strongest currencies available on the ICONOMI platform (based on market cap), with the ICONOMI (ICN) token added as the 20th asset. Any new assets added to the ICONOMI platform that fall within the scope of the DAA strategy will be added to the portfolio in the next month's rebalancing cycle.
