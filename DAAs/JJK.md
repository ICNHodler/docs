# DAA Strategy
> JJK's strategy is to divide the portfolio into two parts. The first part is the core, which includes established, well-known cryptocurrencies such as ETH, XMR, and DASH. The team plans to keep the core stable by rebalancing it less frequently and keeping the composition of the assets mostly unchanged. The second part of the portfolio consists of assets from promising, innovative, and undervalued projects with high growth potential. These assets can potentially bring high profits, but they also bring the risk, so the team plans to rebalance and modify this part of the portfolio more frequently.
