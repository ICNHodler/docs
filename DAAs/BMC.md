# DAA Strategy
> This DAA has moderate risk and high performance objectives. The strategy will be quite simple: I will buy into fundamentally strong projects, and sell them when the market mania starts and prices no longer reflect the "real" value of the assets. I will also rebalance if new and better opportunities arise (better risk/ratio opportunities).
