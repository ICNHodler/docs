# CARUS-AR (CAR)
CARUS-AR is a [Digital Asset Array](../Digital-Asset-Arrays.md) managed by Menno Peter Pietersen who runs his own full-service web agency in the Netherlands. CAR was one of the original batch of DAAs launched on the ICONOMI platform and currently contains 21 assets varying in weight from 15% to 2%. Annual management fee is 2.75%.

# DAA Strategy
> The general strategy for investing in the growing crypto market is: diversify and hold (HODL); regular rebalancing every month-sell a small percentage of well performing assets, reinvest in good opportunities; additional rebalancing if an asset surpasses 25% weight or makes large moves up; emergency rebalancing during critical events (CARUS-AR does not sell on panic or news, but we do try to trade major events); no maximum number of assets, which are added based on fundamental analysis and potential.
