# DAA Strategy
> We believe that Ethereum and related ERC-20 compliant tokens and applications that run on the Ethereum blockchain will provide a foundation layer to support higher level application use cases on the blockchain. In addition we believe that Bitcoin will continue to tend towards becoming a digital gold like store of value, and that blockchains focused on anonymity will be used for payment transactions to ensure confidentiality. The holdings within the portfolio are biased towards assets with major adoption and market caps, plus a number of satellite assets that provide exposure to complimentary elements that comprise a complete blockchain architecture.
