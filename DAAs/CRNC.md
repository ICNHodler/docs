# Cornucopia Index (CRNC)
CRNC is a [Digital Asset Array](../Digital-Asset-Arrays.md) managed by Elad Shtilerman who has a PhD in mathematical ecology and has worked on governance protocols for Israeli-based blockchain startup 'Backfeed'. CRNC currently contains 16 assets varying in weight from 50% to 0.5%. Annual management fee is 1.3%.

# DAA Strategy
> I anticipate the strongest, low-risk growth for Ethereum, and ether will comprise about 50-60 percent of the array. Beyond that, I believe that in the relatively short term of 1-2 years, currency-sector coins such as bitcoin, dash, litecoin, monero, and zcash carry great potential for mass adoption. About 30 percent of the portfolio will be comprised of these.... application-level projects will be included at a total of about 20 percent to complete the array. For the longer term, as more cryptocurrencies and tokens become available on the platform and decentralized applications mature, their weight in the array will be increased.
