### ABOUT DAA
The Asymmetry DAA (AAAX) targets practical business offerings geared toward the basic needs of users operating in the blockchain environment, or in other words, where sufficient scalability has been achieved.

Higher weightings are given to more developed opportunities: either by number of accepted users, stronger scalability, and/or cashflow generators for owners of the selected assets. We seek to gain exposure to those assets that have proven first mover status in terms of a developed live product, raised significant capital, have a well-connected investor base, and have a strong "moat" built around their market position.

The AAAX will cover the following elements of the blockchain (in order of preference/weighting): digitalcurrencies, network support and security, payment solutions (real world), gaming/entertainment, business support services, digitizing assets, prediction models, banking the "unbankable," application, content, and token creation platforms.

### ABOUT DAA MANAGER
We at Asymmetry found ourselves asking: What has changed in the world? What assumptions do people make that are no longer true? Why does it feel like everything is speeding up? The fact is, a lot has changed. Yet, when we look at the global financial services industry, very little has changed-enter the blockchain. Secondly, what products and services are being offered that are new, better, and faster-surely the same should be happening to one's investments? It is for this reason that we are focused on the blockchain and how we can contribute to a change in the global financial system.

Kenny Hearn is Director of Asymmetry Asset Management and has been researching and investing in blockchain assets for over four years. He manages the Asymmetry A hedge fund based out of South Africa, and his track record has been greater than 25% per annum for the past three years. Kenny Hearn and Asymmetry have now turned their focus toward managing assets in the blockchain and intend on gaining significant returns for the AAAX in the years to come.

### DAA STRATEGY
The blockchain is in the development stages of an entirely new infrastructure offering on the planet. Therefore, diversification in these early stages of the AAAX will contribute to gaining the benefit of the overall market upliftment. As the assets' business models develop, we will upweight the AAAX toward asymmetric opportunities. Asymmetry is gained through an investment with a high margin of safety and significant upside potential. The same in-depth research and analytics that we apply to the hedge fund positions will be applied to those in the AAAX.

Fact is, many of these ICOs are promising big things, and the upside potential is massive for most. However, not all are likely to succeed, and therefore holdings will be actively monitored for liquidity and systemic risks. We expect the simplest and most practical value-add products and services to win in the initial stages. As the winners of tomorrow become obvious based on our key operational and financial metrics, so the AAAX's exposure to these opportunities will increase.
