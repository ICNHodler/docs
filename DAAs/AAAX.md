# The Asymmetry Asset Array Index (AAAX)
AAAX is a [Digital Asset Array](../Digital-Asset-Arrays.md) managed by Kenny Hearn who is Director of Asymmetry Asset Management, a South African-based hedge fund. AAAX currently contains 48 assets varying in weight from 7% to 0.5%. Annual management fee is 2.5%.

# DAA Strategy
> As the assets' business models develop, we will upweight the AAAX toward asymmetric opportunities. Asymmetry is gained through an investment with a high margin of safety and significant upside potential. The same in-depth research and analytics that we apply to the hedge fund positions will be applied to those in the AAAX.
> Fact is, many of these ICOs are promising big things, and the upside potential is massive for most. However, not all are likely to succeed, and therefore holdings will be actively monitored for liquidity and systemic risks.
