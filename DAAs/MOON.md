# DAA Strategy
> For our DAA structure, we applied the Black-Litterman model, which is an advanced and complex asset weight allocation model developed by Fischer Black and Robert Litterman of Goldman Sachs. The Black-Litterman model is essentially a combination of the two main theories of modern portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and Harry Markowitz's mean-variance optimization theory, adding to these a constant weighting (rebalancing) for the asset allocation model.
