# TRADE (TRADE)
TRADE is a [Digital Asset Array](../Digital-Asset-Arrays.md) managed by Trade.be which is a group of Belgian tech nerds and geeks (their own words), founded by Cain Ransbottyn. TRADE currently contains 10 assets with weights from 20% to 3%. Annual management fee is 3%.

# DAA Strategy
> The Trade.be team takes a radical (or different) approach. While it is the mother of all crypto, BTC has not proven to be a long-term, highly profitable investment. The BTC position will be kept under 5% for withdrawal and deposit purposes. The team puts its efforts into analyzing undervalued altcoins to understand their technical feasibility and combines multiple analyses of the long-term mission and vision of each coin.
