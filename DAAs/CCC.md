# DAA Strategy
> 70% of the portfolio is comprised of blockchain protocols that have wide real-world adoption. This portion is considered the "core" of the Crush Crypto Core DAA, and the holdings will not change dramatically from month to month. The other 30% of the portfolio is comprised of high-quality undervalued tokens, selected based on Crush Crypto's signature evaluation process. This portion is expected to deliver a higher return and to be changed and rebalanced more frequently on a monthly basis.
