# Phoenix Paradigm Indicator (PPI)
PPI is a [Digital Asset Array](../Digital-Asset-Arrays.md) managed by Phoenix Decentralized Solutions, a 3 person team of Dirk-Jan Dorr, Nathan Hartman & Maarten Dorr. PPI currently contains 16 assets varying in weight from 15% to 2.5%. Annual management fee is 2.5%.

# DAA Strategy
> Confirmation of the paradigm happens when the Phoenix Paradigm Indicator contains 10 assets weighted at 10% each. This is the goal of the Phoenix Paradigm Index. Assets weighted at >10% will change to 10% in the future. Ethereum and 0x are the only assets that will be weighted above 10%. Any asset weighted between 2.5% and 10% is a candidate to grow to 10% weighting, which means a permanent spot in the DAA. Assets can only be adjusted by steps of 2.5% per quarter, up or down, depending on their performance. Assets can only be subject to removal when they are weighted at 2.5%. New additions to the DAA will have to be in line with our vision and performance demands.
