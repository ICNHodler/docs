# DAA Strategy
> SOPR utilizes an equal weight investment strategy, assigning each asset in the portfolio an equal share. This strategy offers investors better diversification and more balanced allocation. It reduces concentration risk and provides more exposure to smaller assets with higher growth potential. The outperformance of equal weight investment strategies has been historically confirmed in all major global stock markets. Solidum Prime is rebalanced either on a monthly basis or more frequently due to the fast-changing crypto environment.
