# DAA Strategy
> The Third Eye Array (TEA) is for everyone who longs to leave this world a better place. Assets from projects with unsustainable ideas, malicious motivations, or relationships with institutions clamoring for central control have no place in our array.
> We aim for long-term growth and preparation for the emerging "token economy," employing a medium to high-risk profile that is well-diversified.
> Our integrity is built on the following mindset: value over profit, and holistic sustainability first; otherwise, our children won't be able to enjoy any wealth whatsoever.
> TEA is a passive DAA with regular rebalancing. Potential assets are delicately curated and diligently vetted before being included and are reevaluated on a regular basis. Our checklist focuses on: economic (and ecological) sustainability, implicit (currently speculative markets) and explicit (actual live code: algorithm, app) performance, as well as the project's community (quality and quantity).
> Enjoy life. Have some TEA.
