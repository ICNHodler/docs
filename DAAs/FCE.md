# DAA Strategy
> The weighted selection of coins has been produced with the aim of outperforming the market while minimizing exposure to corrections. The top three coins serve as the core holdings. In addition to the core holdings, weighted exposure is given to the most exciting projects in the top 20, 50, 100, and 200 coins. This strategy provides broad market exposure while mitigating the risk of a single coin dominating and thereby acting as a central source of risk.
