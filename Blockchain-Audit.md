# Blockchain Audits

ICONOMI have established a Blockchain Audit protocol to demonstrate that they as a company are solvent, and that all company and user holdings are correctly reported. 

> ICONOMI's first blockchain audit represents one of the most important milestones so far, another bridge we have built between the old and the new economy, and another step we have made toward transparency and trust.

The audit protocol entails ICONOMI proving ownership of all their stored assets to Deloitte, a third party auditor.

The most recent audit occurred on [April 5th, 2018.](https://www.iconomi.net/proof-of-solvency/201804)
It is not yet known how frequently ICONOMI will carry out audits.


# User Verification

Additionally, the merkle tree technique ICONOMI used to carry out the audit of user accounts without compromising user confidentiality allows a user to verify that ICONOMI correctly included that user's holdings in the audit. 
Each ICONOMI Account has the ability to audit that account's balance at the time of the audit, using merkle tree hashes discoverable on the ICONOMI platform's Account section when logged in.
