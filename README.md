# Welcome, ICN Hodlers

Keeping these docs up to date will be a tedious, ongoing process but they'll form a critical part of the ICNHodler website and ultimately help newcomers to understand what Iconomi is, how it works and why it matters. To update a page, just go to https://github.com/ICNHodler/docs, select a page and click on the edit button. When ready you'll need to save changes and create a pull request so that it can be reviewed by an admin who ultimately has the final say over whether changes will be accepted (but they will be provided they add value).
